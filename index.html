    <p>Hi, this is my personal website. I have now redirected this link to my website. If you know who I am, come to me on November 5th, 2024 at school today. I will give you the new link. Some people paid to get the website and its unfair that people get it for free, so im going to make a new website. Again, if you know who I am, please come to me at school, NOT after school, Thank you. Hint: James Demitropoulous didn't buy me ice cream todayw ehn he said he was going to. Kinda the whole reason im making a new website. Not giving it to you this time james, :)</p>
